# neotrellis-grid-paletted-plus-for-M0-RP2040

Modified code for SAMD21/51 M0/M4 and RP2040 originally from https://github.com/oldmanfury ... which is modified code originally from https://github.com/okyeron. 

You will have to complie it in Arduino for your specific board. Dont forget to select "TinyUSB" as the USB stack and have the required libraries and board definitions installed.

Original code and installation instructions here: https://github.com/okyeron/neotrellis-monome/tree/master/neotrellis_monome_teensy  and here:https://github.com/oldmanfury/neotrellis-grid-paletted

The Paletted_Plus vesion adds a 4th page of color choices (subtle variations of white) along with a few additional variables that should make it easier to add additional color pages without having to change stuff elsewhere in the code.   Configure this in the "User Variables" section near the top after the libraries.
