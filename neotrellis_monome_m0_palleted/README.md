# neotrellis monome compatible grid

Neotrellis Grid Code for M0 and M4 controllers.

This code should work with any of the various SAMD21/51 M0/M4 controllers such as Adafruit Feather, ItsyBitsy, etc or Seeed Xiao SAMD21 

__NOTE__ - You will need to recompile the code for the specific board you are using. 

Step 1: Be sure update to the most recent TinyUSB library version. If you're using Arduino, it's best to use Manage Libraries in Arduino to install/update TinyUSB.

Step 2: Be sure you check the board addresses for your build and adjust the code as needed if you do something different than the default described here.
